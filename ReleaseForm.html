			<p> By signing this form you are agreeing to the terms listed below:<br>
You are agreeing to the haircut described above in the text box and the price listed above.<br>
You understand that if your dog is matted, we will have to shave it, we do not try to comb out big mats that are all the way to the skin as that is too painful for the dog.<br>
You understand that if your dog is old or has health problems that the possibility exists for your dog to pass away while under our care and that this is not our fault.<br>
You understand that we do not use muzzles here, and so if your dog stresses out too much about a certain part of the grooming process, we will simply not do it. This does not change the price of the groom.<br>
You understand that if your dog has fleas we will use a flea shampoo to get rid of them but this does not prevent more fleas from jumping on him or her once you leave, we recommend using a flea preventative you can get from the vet. (The vet has all sorts of nifty things we do not have access to)<br>
You understand that grooming takes a lot more time than most people think and we will call you as soon as your dog is finished. You promise not to call every hour or come barging into the salon insisting you need your dog back RIGHT NOW.  If you do this and we are not finished, you will still pay the full price for the unfinished groom. <br>
You agree to make sure we have the correct phone number and keep that phone on you at all times during the grooming process. Lots of things can go wrong and we may need to contact you immediately if your dog has an emergency. <br>
Lastly, you understand that working with animals is highly unpredictable and by signing this document you waive any right to sue for said unpredictability.
